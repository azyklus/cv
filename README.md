# Cirriculum Vitae

In this repository is located the cirriculum vitae of AZYKLUS for year 2023.

### How to build

First and foremost, you will need the Tectonic Typesetting binaries, which can be installed
through Homebrew, APT, WinGet, or whichever package manager you use.
```sh
sudo apt install tectonic
winget install tectonic
brew install tectonic
#...et cetera#
```

Or you can install Tectonic's binaries manually through their [website](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/)

Once you have Tectonic installed, building the CV is as simple as running `tectonic -X build`
in the root directory of the repo.

### Pre-built

You can find a prebuilt CV on the [Releases page](https://github.com/azyklus/cv/releases) of this repository.
