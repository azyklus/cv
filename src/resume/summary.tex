\begin{cvparagraph}
   My objective is to obtain full-time employment in a rewarding atmosphere that makes use of my
   notable skills.

   As a programmer, I have built many projects over the years from the ground up and have extensive
   experience leading among my peers. I also have a history of good productivity and generally I have
   been known to be knowledgable in various fields.

   In creating my organisation and building my Other Skies app, I learned a number of different skills
   in systems administration and development operations out of necessity. I built computers both for
   personal use, and to be used as server systems with remote access and full-stack hosting capabilities.
   I also learned to use many AWS, GitLab, and container system features to facilitate hosting this
   application.

   I enjoy contributing to open source projects and I love to build. Overall, I believe creativity
   and empathy are what sets me apart from the average individual and yet also enable me to work
   with many disparate groups. I love to learn new things and the pursuit of understanding is a folly
   with which I am greatly familiar and fully embrace.
